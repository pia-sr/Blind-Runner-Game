# Blind Runner Game
*by Pia Schroeter*

**This runner game for Android was created for the bachelor thesis with the topic: Accessibility in Video Games: Designing and Developing a Concept for Accessibility in Mobile Games for Blind and Visually Impaired People**

## Premise
In this game, the player is an armadillo that runs through a foggy forest at night. The armadillo can move on three lanes and needs to evade obstacles. The score in the game depends on the collected lights by the armadillo.

## Accessibility Features
With the help of these accessibility features, people with visual impairments can also play the game. These accessibility features are [phone habtics](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator), [text-to-speech implementation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech) and the [feelSpace naviBelt](https://github.com/feelSpace/FSLib-Android/tree/master). The [feelSpace naviBelt](https://feelspace.de/) is an aid device that helps people with visual impairments to orientate themselves and to navigate.

## Missing Assets
Some assets are missing in this repo because they were paid for. Every asset except for [the background](https://strawliondev.itch.io/forest-backgrounds), [the obstacles](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/stylized-nature-forest-238303) (i.e. the stones) and [the armadillo](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/cute-zoo-4-198671) is included in the repo.
